# chemical_equation_balancer
With this script you can solve almost any chemical equation/reaction (it has been tested on different kinds of equations/reactions) except the ones that can not be balanced (example: Ca(PO4)2 + SiO2 = P4O10 + CaSiO3 has 0 possible ways to balance) or the ones that have infinite possible ways to balance (example: As2S3 + NO3 + H2O = AsO4 + H + NO + S can be balanced in infinite ways )
# good luck
