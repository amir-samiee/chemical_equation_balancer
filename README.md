# Chemical Equation/Reaction Balancer
With this script, you can solve almost any chemical equation/reaction (it has been tested on different kinds of equations/reactions) except the ones that can not be balanced or the ones that have infinite possible ways to balance.

example of impossible reactions: Ca(PO4)2 + SiO2 = P4O10 + CaSiO3 
This equation has 0 possible ways to balance.

example of infinite reactions: As2S3 + NO3 + H2O = AsO4 + H + NO + S 
This equation can be balanced in infinite ways.

# How to enter my reaction?!
You can enter your reactions in 8 different forms:

1) reagents = products
2) reagents => products
3) reagents ==> products
4) reagents ===> products
5) reagents -> products
6) reagents --> products
7) reagents ---> products
8) reagents â†’ products
exsample : Cu + HNO3 ==> Cu(NO3)2 + NO + H2O

# Test some reactions
If you enter "test", the program will show you some reactions and balances them.

# Usage 
```
pip install colorama
pip install numpy
